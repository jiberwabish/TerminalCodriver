- no tab completion -- working on it though not sure if this is possible but I sure hope it is!
- llm ip and port are hardcoded regardless of .env currently -- easy fix, just gotta do it
- maybe should include convo history instead of just clearing it after every chat
- will also require a !reset command to clear history on command
- need a !help command to list banner again once it's scrolled off screen if needed
- not sure how readline will be handled in requirements as it will fail on windows, which is why pyreadline is there
